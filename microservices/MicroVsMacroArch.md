# Macro Architecture

`Macro architecture` consists of all decisions that can be made at a global level and apply to all microservices whereas 
`micro architecture` comprises all decisions that can be made individually for each microservice. The overarching 
macro architecture applies to all microservices, whereas the micro architecture deals with 
individual microservices so that each microservice has its own micro architecture.
